Documentation for this function can be found in the [API reference](https://slideruleearth.io/web/rtd/api_reference/icesat2.html#atl03sp).\n",

    "In the example below, a set of resources is specified via the `poly`, `rgt`, and `cycle` parameters.  Because each granule contains so many photons, it is necessary when making this call to limit the area over which the subsetting request is made, along with the number of granules inside that area. By supplying a GeoJSON file (which is read and processed by the `sliderule.toregion` function into a format usable by SlideRule), the extent of data read in each granule is trimmed.  By supplying a reference ground track (`rgt`), and the cycle number, the number of granules is reduced - in this case to a single granule.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other parameters in the request are used to specify different aspects of the ATL03 subsetting request.  The `srt` parameters specifies the surface type, which in this case is land. The surface type is used in conjunction with the next parameter - `cnf` which is the confidence level.  A confindence level of high tells SlideRule to only include photons that are highly likely to be surface reflections off of land.  (As a different example, if the `srt` parameter specified land ice and the confidence level was low, then SlideRule would include all photons that had *at least* a low likelihood of being a reflection off of land ice). Lastly, the `len` and `res` parameters specify the length and resolution of the photon segments being returned.  In this case we are asking for 20m segments of photons every 20m.  The length and step size of the segment does not matter so much if it is only photons being returned, but when other processing parameters are supplied (like minimal along track spread of a segment), then it matters more.\n",

    "For the request below there are only ~1K photons returned.  In the actual data, there are roughly ~300K high-confidence photons inside the Grand Mesa region in the selected granule.  The reason so few photons are returned is because the length of the segment is set to 20m and the default along-track-spread required for a valid segment is also 20m (because the default segment length is 40m).  As a result, most segments are filtered out by SlideRule as not being valid.  This happens all the time to me - I get back a lot less data than I expected because I inadvertantly changed one parameter without changing another parameter related to it.  In this case, the way to get all of the photons would be to either change the along-track-spread to 40m (\"ats\": 40), or tell SlideRule to return invalid segments (\"pass_invalid\": True).  I left it this way below because I wanted to highlight this common issue, and also because the smaller datasets is faster to load into a GeoDataFrame. \n",
